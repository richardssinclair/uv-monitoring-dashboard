# Front end Developer Role -  Technical Challenge

The objective of the technical challenge is to allow the candidate to demonstrate the skills needed for the role
and serve as a basis for the final interview stage where we will be exploring the answers to gain a better 
understanding of the candidate’s knowledge and experience. 

*Completing the questions is not a requirement, however we encourage candidates to take the opportunity
 to showcase their skills and knowledge of best practices, whilst being respectful of the time being invested.
  Please add the time it has taken to complete each section as part of your answer. 
  (This will not influence our decision as the challenge is not time bound.)*

## Section:

*This section aims to test the practical skills of building a web application, candidates only need to focus on the frontend.*
*It consists of 4 stages that increase in difficulty, full completion is not essential.*
*A brief guideline on the things we will be looking for are:* 
* Code standards 
* Testing 
* Ability to conceptualise analytical tools
* Design patterns
* Framework familiarity
* Ability to translate requirements into features in a pragmatic way. 

Description: 
>ThinkTribe clients have been interested on the effects of direct sun exposure on shoppers and how it influences their decisions.  
>Our Product Owners are now requesting a new feature for the Monitoring Portal to track UV light 24/7 in the London area as a first step.


### Stage 1 (Investigation): 
*During the initial feasibility study the backend engineers recommended  
 using any weather API from here: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file#weather (https://www.openuv.io/),  
 this has been approved and the application will consist of a frontend consuming data from it.* 

You have been tasked with producing an initial low-fidelity wireframe of how the main page should look and feel.  
(Refer to the case study below.)

Tasks:
* Please include an image of your design(s). 

### Stage 2 (Implementing essential features):

*The product manager informed you that all key stakeholders are happy with the wireframe and would like to proceed with the next steps.*  
*(If you have provided more than one, select one for implementation.)*

Based on the case study complete the tasks below:
* Create an initial frontend application using a framework of your choice (React). (It’s okay if you’d rather use a different one.)
* Create a page and add a minimum of two relevant components to it. At least one component must be a graph.

### Stage 3 (Agile iteration based on user feedback):

*Our clients are thrilled, adoption is increasing and with it comes more feature requests!*

* Support multiple locations selected by the users.
* Allow the configuration of a UV threshold.


### Stage 4 (Bonus: Making it fancy!):

*The product owner proposed a few new features/modifications that will help conquer the hearts of the more reluctant clients
 that are still refusing to adopt the solution.*

Still using the case study as a reference consider the following tasks:
* Make it auto refresh, so it can be used in a live screen for example!
* Define a live ranking, with the highest UV exposed places at the top.

## CASE STUDY

Our clients track the total amount of sales per hour and what might have an impact on it:

* Availability of their websites (tracked by us)
* Specific user journeys and functionality within their websites (tracked by us)
* UV light exposure. (There's strong scientific evidence that it is the most influential marker for sales.) (NOT :D)
* Temperature
* Chance of rain
* Air humidity
* Level of CO2

This will be used to inform their analysts and AI systems to make strategical decisions on the spot to offer flash discounts on umbrellas for example!

## OBSERVATIONS

* Feel free to change the subject slightly depending on the API of choice. Therefore substituting UV exposure for temperature or another value with constant change. 
* Depending on the API used if no historical data retrieval is available feel free to use some mock data for initial load.
* The details of look and feel are purposefully left open to interpretation and it is part of the challenge. (Stage 1)
